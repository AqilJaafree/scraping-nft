This is just testing to scrape the nft from pentas.io using selenium library

NFT Scraping with Selenium
This project aims to scrape NFT (Non-Fungible Token) data from a website using the Selenium library in Python. Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers and can be used to interact with web pages, fill out forms, click buttons, and scrape data.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x
Selenium library
WebDriver for your chosen browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)
Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nft-scraping.git

2. Change into the project directory:
cd nft-scraping

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install selenium

Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser and operating system. Make sure to place the WebDriver executable in your system's PATH.

Chrome: ChromeDriver
Firefox: GeckoDriver
Safari: SafariDriver is pre-installed on macOS
Usage
Open the scrape_nft.py file in a text editor.

Modify the URL variable to the website URL from which you want to scrape NFT data.

Customize the scraping logic within the scrape_nft_data() function. You can use Selenium's methods to locate elements, extract data, and interact with the webpage as needed.

Save the changes.

Run the scrape_nft.py script:

python scrape_nft.py

The script will launch a browser window, navigate to the specified URL, and execute the scraping logic.

Once the scraping is complete, the script will output the extracted data or save it to a file, depending on your implementation.
